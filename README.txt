COMP 20, Spring 2013
Assignment 1: My Portfolio
Author: Derek DuPont
Date: 2/4/2012
----------------------------

Relevant files:
index.html
-This is the home page, containing links to other pages, as well as an image of the author.
bio.html
-Contains a short biography of the author.
resume.html
-Contains the author's resume.
desktop.css
-Stylesheet used to properly display content on larger devices (ie, desktops and laptops)
mobile.css
-Stylesheet used to properly display content on smaller devices (smartphones)

This assignment was successful in that the required materials are displayed in an
aesthetically pleasing, yet functional, manner on both large and small devices.
Differences between the two platforms include: the size of the author's image 
(so it fully appears on a phone screen without scrolling), default text size on 
the phone (zooming isn't needed initially), and the link to the home page
was designed differently (static vs fixed).

This assignment took about 6 or 7 hours, mainly due to the author's unfamiliarity with
html and css.
